This is a simple mystery-solving game for CSS learners to develop
their debugging skills.

CSS snippets are randomly "broken" in one of a variety of ways based on
observation of CSS learners in [ScriptEd][] classes
at [Brooklyn International High School][bihs]. Players must tap the part
of the snippet that is broken to solve the mystery.
